    "    Before dicussing the entire concept of a Heap Sort its important to understand what a Heap is at its core. <br><br>\n",
    "    <h4>Heap</h4>\n",
    "    A Heap is a binary tree, with a maximum of two children, Heap come in either Min or Max and are basically just a inverse of each other. The shape of a Heap is similar to a Tree where it starts with one node on the top, and grows progressively wider on the bottom depending on the size of the heap, essentially doubling in size every row since one node can only have two children. Depending on the type of heap the node of the top will either be the smallest or largest number depending on if its a min or max Heap respectively. Nodes are implemented into the tree from top to bottom, left to right order. <br><br>\n",
    "    <h4>Heap Sort</h4> <br><br>\n",
    "    Heap Sort is a popular sorting method, known for its simplicity and efficiency. It can be described in its most simple form as follows\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "      <li>Eliminate the nodes one by one from the \"tree\" part of the list</li>\n",
    "      <li>Then insert them into the sorted part of the list</li>\n",
