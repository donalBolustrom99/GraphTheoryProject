    "    <h3>Heap</h3>\n",
    "    A Heap is a binary tree, with a maximum of two children, Heap come in either Min or Max and are basically just a inverse of each other. The shape of a Heap is similar to a Tree where it starts with one node on the top, and grows progressively wider on the bottom depending on the size of the heap, essentially doubling in size every row since one node can only have two children. Depending on the type of heap the node of the top will either be the smallest or largest number depending on if its a min or max Heap respectively. Nodes are implemented into the tree from top to bottom, left to right order. <br><br>\n",
    "    <h3>Heap Sort</h3>\n",
    "    Heap Sort is a popular sorting method, known for its simplicity and efficiency. It can be described in its most simple form as follows\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "      <li>Eliminate the nodes one by one from the \"tree\" part of the list</li>\n",
    "      <li>Then insert them into the sorted part of the list</li>\n",

    "    Its important to discuss why choosing one method over another is so important. There are many different ways of sorting everything in life and it does not stop at computing. The main measure in computer is <b>Big O Notation</b>, more on that below. In computing, sometimes some methods work very well with smaller runtimes and not well with long runtimes and vice versa, its important to find a good balance between size and speed with these algorithms. Algorithms are dividing into complexity classes, which is most commonly seen as the Landau symbol <b>\"Big O\"</b> <br>\n",
    "    <h4>Big O Notation</h4>\n",
    "    In this case regarding the Heap Sort, its time complexity is identified as O(n log n) which is also called <b>Quasilinear Time</b> theres many way of saying this but I personally say <b>Big O of n Log n</b>. With this type of Big O, the power used is highest at the start of the algorithm, but slows down towards the end eventually leading less power being used.\n",
