# GraphTheoryProject

# Prerequisite

Step 1) It's important to install Git to be able to copy the repository  https://git-scm.com/downloads  
Step 2) You will also need Anaconda, This is where the Jupyter Notebooks are made  https://www.anaconda.com  

NB. There is a Anaconda Mini, but I have not tested if it has the files to run my Notebooks  

# How to Open Jupyter NoteBook

Step 1) Create a folder anywhere on local computer  
Step 2) Navigate to the folder and type "CMD" in the file explores directory

Step 5) Open the CMD we opened earlier type type "git clone "the link copied from the repository"  
Step 6) Type in the CMD cd GraphTheoryProject  
Step 7) Type in the CMD Jupyter notebook  

This will start you session and run a server off the CMD previously opened  
Sessions are run on http://localhost:8888/tree but the window should open automatically after server is running.

# What is this for?

This Repository was created as a project for my third year of collage, the task was to tackle some of the problems we see in the world of computing and to practice our researching skills. In the repository there are two jupyter notebooks which describe contents suchs as the Graph Iomorphism Problem and the componets of it and a discussion about Heap Sort and its components. Within the notebook HTML is used as the decribing factors and Python is used to run some basic code. The contents of the books contain information gathered from our Lecturer at the time and information from the internet. References are availible at the end of both notebooks.
